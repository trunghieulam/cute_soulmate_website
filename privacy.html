    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Date]</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Cute Soulmate ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile app.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        Our app does <strong>not collect personal information</strong> from users. Game progress and settings are stored locally on your device only.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        We store game progress, high scores, pet customizations, and preferences exclusively on your device. We do not access or store this information externally.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The Cute Soulmate app does not currently utilize third-party services that collect user data.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app is suitable for all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        While we strive to protect your in-app data, please be aware that no method of electronic storage is completely secure. Since data is stored only on your device, please take steps to protect your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
